<!-- badges: end -->

The [jsoncons][] C++ header-only library constructs representations
from a JSON character vector, and provides extensions for flexible
queries and other operations on JSON objects. This package has simple
'R' wrappers to support [JSONpath][] and [JMESpath][] queries into JSON
strings or 'R' objects. The 'jsoncons' library is also be easily
linked to other packages for direct access to 'C++' functionality.

## Use cases

The [introductory vignette][] outlines common use cases, including:

- Filtering large JSON documents to extract records of interest.
- Extracting deeply nested elements.
- Transforming data for more direct incorporation in *R* data structures.

The [jsoncons][] C++ header-only library is a very useful starting
point for advance JSON manipulation. The vignette outlines how
[rjsoncons][] can be used by other *R* packages wishing to access the
C++ library.

## Next steps

See the [introductory vignette][] for additional details.
